                    Being one of the nerds at school, I have been always grateful for the existence of computer and the internet, that I could access to information. I liked to explore materials to learn various softwares without waiting for my computer teacher to introduce to us. In early 2000s, I hosted my first homepage in Geocities JP. It was fun to think of various themes and designs to put on my homepage back then.

                <p>That was old story though.</p>

                    Despite my passion about science, I am also fascinated by history and ended up in humanities. I studied Religious studies and Philosophy for my first degree and then pursued Japanese Studies for my postgraduate degree. I learnt to skim tons of information and make analysis out of it. I became good at it and mainly, enjoy it a lot.

                    Theory cannot be totally extracted from practice. I resigned my office job and then travelled from Hong Kong through Siberia to the UK by land in 2015 summer. I wished to experience different culture and understand people more. I made connection with various encounters, working as waitress at busy restaurant, babysitter, carer, sale assistant at supermarket and machine operator in manufacturing sector.

                    In 2021 summer, thanks to a friend, I hesitantly decided to resume my exploration to technology through freeCodeCamp. Deeper I digged into it, more amazed by the drastic changes over these years. After almost a year of self taught journey, here I am, I joined my coding bootcamp offered by Northcoders to learn with other peers and mentors.

                    Humanity can get this far because we learnt from experience and pass our knowledge around and to next generation. Despite my long pause in technology, I gained various experience in my life and I believe I could apply mine into programming.

                    Undoubtfully, our internet has been improved over these years in many aspects and that's done thanks to our constant search for betterness. I aspire to instill my insight gained from my study in humanities and my experience with people into my projects, to add more colours into this vast boundaryless community.

                    Oh, other than the above, I strive for clean code. I believe we can find a balance between our urge to move forward and a long term sustainability based on strong foundation.
